A simple 3D CNN with pytorch\n","\n","Here, we will create a very simple 3D Convolutional Neural Network on some toy data. This is meant as a quick introduction into the pytorch framework if you haven't used it yet. It will cover everything you need to know for the following parts of the exercise; if you want to go into a bit more detail about the framework, a good place to start is the official [pytorch quickstart tutorial](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/basics/quickstart_tutorial.html).\n","\n","A very useful resource if you want to know more about a certain class or function are the [official docs](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html). Take a minute to look at the documentation of a [Tensor](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/tensors.html?highlight=tensor#torch.Tensor) which is the data structure pytorch uses throughout their APIs. It is comparable to a numpy array, with added functionality such as the ability to move seamlessly between cpu host memory and cuda device memory or the integrated autograd functionality for automatic differentiation. Most importantly, you can create a tensor from a numpy array with `torch.from_numpy(array)` and the other way around with `array = tensor.numpy()`.\n","\n","Our objective with this 3D CNN is to simply classify if a given SDF is containing a sphere or a torus. The data is generated the same way we did it in the last exercise (we randomize the shape parameters a bit so the task is not too trivial). Each such sample has a scalar label associated with it, either 0 or 1, depending on the shape it contains.\n","\n","All of the implementation in this part will take place in `exercise_2/simple_nn.py`. This makes sense for now but note that we would usually spread things over multiple different files like in the following exercise parts.\n","\n","The important bits we need for every training in pytorch are:\n","1. The **dataset** implementation. This is a class responsible for providing the data used by the training procedure sample-by-sample. In its simplest form, it just loads data samples (eg. point clouds or voxel grids) from disk. However, it is usually also used to transform raw data from disk into the correct format and to apply various kinds of augmentations.\n","2. The network definition (\"**model**\") that we want to train. It specifies the network structure (number and type of layers, activation functions, normalization layers etc.) as well as how exactly input data is processed.\n","3. The **loss function**: For classification, this is usually a Cross Entropy Loss; we will also see reconstruction losses like l1 and l2 in exercise 3.\n","4. The **optimizer**: Usually chosen from a set of pre-defined classes like SGD or ADAM.\n","5. The **training loop**: For each batch of data, it does the following: Loads data from the dataloader, passes it through the model (\"forward pass\"), computes the loss, calculates the gradients (\"backward pass\"), and finally, adjusts the network weights using the optimizer.\n","\n","Let's walk through everything step-by-step:"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"sYBMv09BqH7R"},"source":["### (a) Dataset\n","\n","We start by implementing the data source, which is called `Dataset` in pytorch. Take a look at the `SimpleDataset` class, it contains everything we have to implement to make it work:\n","1. The `__init__` function that takes paramters and prepares the dataset by setting paths etc. Here, the one thing you always have to do is to load at least a list of samples you want to use - they don't have to be loaded from disk yet, but you need to know which and how many samples there are. This usually also depends on the current split - you use a different set of samples for training than for validation or testing.\n","2. The `__len__` function that returns the total number of samples. In most cases, this will simply be the length of the list of samples you prepared in `__init__`.\n","3. The `__getitem__` function. This is where the actual dataloading takes place. The function gets an index between 0 and the length you returned with `__len__`. Your job is then to return some data corresponding to the index. You do not need to worry about putting data onto the GPU here yet; instead, you load the data and return a tuple containing numpy arrays and other data like sample ids you might need in your training loop. Overall, you should take the index parameter in this function, find the sample id it belongs to, load that data, and then return it in a format that can be used in the training loop.\n","\n","Note that it is also fine to load all data into a list in the `__init__` function for small datasets like our toy dataset in this exercise part. You would then just index this pre-loaded data in your `__getitem__` function.\n","\n","Add and implement functions `__init__`, `__len__`, and `__getitem__` in class `SimpleDataset`.\n","\n","First, implement `__init__`: It takes a single parameter (called `split`) that determines if we are using train or val split at the moment. Based on that, it should generate toy data: 4096 samples if the split is train and 1024 if it is val. Use `generate_toy_data` from `exercise_2/util/toy_data.py` for this which generates two numpy arrays: The first one containing sphere and torus SDFs generated with randomized parameters and the second one classification labels, a 0 if the corresponding SDF in the first array is a sphere and 1 if it is a torus.\n","\n","Then, implement `__len__` by simply returning the length of the data you generated in `__init__`.\n","\n","Lastly, implement `__getitem__` which takes an integer index and returns a tuple: A numpy array containing the input SDF volume as generated by `generate_toy_data` before and a scalar value that represents the target class label for this volume.\n","\n","Note: You have to add an additional dimension of size 1 to the input volume you return in `__getitem__` to make everything work later on, i.e. instead of returning a numpy array of shape (32, 32, 32), you should return an array of shape (1, 32, 32, 32).\n","\n","Test your implementation with the checks below:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":12,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4253,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701723927084,"user":{"displayName":"Berfin Kavşut","userId":"14341270727018230240"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"Gava5d0LqH7R","outputId":"19b0f351-8601-4279-de72-3ace21112646"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Generating toy data ...\n","Generating toy data ...\n","Length of train set: 4096\n","Length of val set: 1024\n","(1, 32, 32, 32)\n","Class = 0\n","(1, 32, 32, 32)\n","Class = 1\n"]}],"source":["from exercise_2.simple_nn import SimpleDataset\n","\n","# Create datasets with train and val splits\n","train_dataset = SimpleDataset('train')\n","val_dataset = SimpleDataset('val')\n","\n","# Test lengths\n","print(f'Length of train set: {len(train_dataset)}')  # expected output: 4096\n","print(f'Length of val set: {len(val_dataset)}')  # expected output: 1024\n","\n","# Get sample at index 0\n","train_sample = train_dataset[0]\n","print(train_sample[0].shape)  # Expected output (1, 32, 32, 32) (the leading 1 is important for later)\n","print(f\"Class = {train_sample[1]}\")  # Expected output: Scalar value 0\n","val_sample = val_dataset[-1]\n","print(val_sample[0].shape)  # Expected output (1, 32, 32, 32) (the leading 1 is important for later)\n","print(f\"Class = {val_sample[1]}\")  # Expected output: Scalar value 1"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4,"status":"ok","timestamp":1701723927084,"user":{"displayName":"Berfin Kavşut","userId":"14341270727018230240"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"2IJ1OCNuqH7R","outputId":"6a4ea532-b606-4587-9b52-4c4e0808d61b"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["(1, 32, 32, 32)\n","Creating SDF visualization for 32^3 grid ...\n","Exported to /content/gdrive/MyDrive/ml43d/ml43d-exercises/exercise2/toy_data.ply\n"]}],"source":["from exercise_2.util.visualization import visualize_sdf\n","\n","train_sample = train_dataset[0]\n","print(train_sample[0].shape)\n","visualize_sdf(train_sample[0].squeeze(0), filename=Path.cwd() / 'toy_data.ply')"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"iHPvdDPNqH7S"},"source":["### (b) Model\n","The model is defined in class `SimpleModel`. Two functions are important here: `__init__` which sets up the architecture by instantiating layers with the correct parameters and adapting them to possible input parameters and `forward` which takes an input tensor (we call it `x` here). The output of `forward` is another tensor that contains the result of the network - in our case, this is a vector of logits which will then be used for classification. It could also be a volume of labels if you do segmentation or a volume of the same size as the input if you do reconstruction.\n","\n","Analogous to `forward`, you could also define a custom `backward` function that describes how to calculate the gradients for your model. However, this is not necessary for most architectures as pytorch's autograd implementation takes care of all of that.\n","\n","For now, we will implement a very simple model: We stack together three 3D Convolution layers and have a fully connected layer at the end for classification. This is a schematic for the overall model structure:\n","<img src=\"exercise_2/images/simplenn.png\" alt=\"simplenn_architecture\" style=\"width: 512px;\"/>\n","\n","Each layer starts with a 3d convolution, followed by a batch normalization layer and a ReLU activation function. We left the implementation of the first layer in there; your task is to fill out the missing parts in `__init__` for layers 2 and 3 (use the same parameters as for the first convolution: kernel size 4, stride 3, padding 1). Each convolution should double the number of feature channels, such that you get a volume of size 16 x 1 x 1 x 1 after layer 3. You also need to define the ReLU and the fully connected layer (for this, use `torch.nn.Linear` to reduce the number of dimensions from 16 to 2).\n","\n","In `forward`, you can repeat the first line to move the input tensor through all three convolutional layers. Then, reshape the resulting tensor to dimension batchsize x 16 (the batch size is always the first dimension) and apply the linear layer to it. Return the result as-is.\n","\n","Hint: The ease of debugging is one of the main reasons why pytorch is preferred in research over alternatives like tensorflow.
